# Hi!

Here is the TLDR;

💾&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote my first line of code at 14, and I've basically never stopped. That early curiosity has fueled a 15+ year professional career and keeps me constantly learning and tinkering with new technologies.  

👨‍💻&nbsp;&nbsp;My professional journey has taken me through Java, C++, PHP, Python, and Ruby, but I’ve found my home in the JavaScript/TypeScript world. I’m not one to just stay on the surface; I love digging into the nuts and bolts of how things work, whether that's on the front-end, the back-end, or anywhere in between.  

💙&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the code, I have a passion for design that goes back to drawing as a kid. The web is the ultimate creative playground for me—a place where I get to merge thoughtful design with clean, effective code. It’s this blend of logic and creativity that makes development more than just a job.
