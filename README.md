# Hey!
My name is **Marlon** and I am a **Senior Full-Stack Developer** @wethegit.

💾&nbsp;&nbsp;I started messing around with computers at a young age and I wrote my first piece of code when I was 14 years old.  

👨‍💻&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been working as a programmer professionally since 2009 and have worked with Java (all through college), Pascal (my intern years), C++ (early in my carreer), PHP, Python and Ruby, but I have the most experience with Javascript/Typescript as Javascript is not only the language of on the client now but it has taken over the server.  

💙&nbsp;&nbsp;I've also always loved design and as a kid I used to draw a lot and the web allows me to also exercise that side by being able to marry design with programming and that's why it's just my work but also my passion.
