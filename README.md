# Hi!

Here is the TLDR;

💾&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote my first line of code at 14, and I've basically never stopped. That early curiosity has fueled a 15+ year professional career and keeps me constantly learning and tinkering with new technologies.  

👨‍💻&nbsp;&nbsp;My professional journey has taken me through Java, C++, PHP, Python, and Ruby, but I’ve found my home in the JavaScript/TypeScript world. I’m not one to just stay on the surface and I actually love digging into the nuts and bolts of how things work, whether that's on the front-end, the back-end, or anywhere in between.  

💙&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the code, I have an appreciation for design that goes back to drawing as a kid and the web is the ultimate creative playground for me as I get to merge design with code. It’s this blend of logic and creativity that makes development more than just a job, it's a passion.
